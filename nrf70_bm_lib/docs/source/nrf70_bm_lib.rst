Introduction
============

nRF70 bare metal library is a library that provides a set of APIs to interact with the nRF70 series of SoCs.
The library is designed to be used in a bare metal environment, and it is not dependent on any RTOS.
This helps customers to port the library to any platform of their choice.

The library uses the OS agnostic nRF70 Wi-Fi library to interact with the nRF70.
